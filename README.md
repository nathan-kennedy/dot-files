# Dot-files for Zsh 💻

If you're looking for a souped up Zshell with lots of awesome tools and decorations, look no further. If you're not into oh-my-zsh because you think it's bloated and offers way more than you actually need, look no further. I don't have a snazzy name for any of this. These are just my dot files, but I did put in a bunch of work trying to do what oh-my-zsh does without using oh-my-zsh, because after initially using omz I was really disappointed. I spent quite a while making everything pretty only to realize my prompt tool over 4 seconds to load... Uh, no. So will the hours I spent doing everything manually make up for the seconds I'll save every time I load Zsh? Perhaps not, but maybe if enough people use these dot files then at some point the time saved will have been worth the effort. Enjoy! 😁

### MotD (Includes quote of the day from zenquotes.io)

_This took way longer than it should have, but I like the result, hope you do too. The terminal window needs to be pretty small width-wise before the formatting is broken so there shouldn't be any problems there. The quote of the day loads from the .zshrc file with a simple curl command. No API key is requited.'Jq' JSON parser (automatically installed with my 'new-mac-setup script) is a prerequisite to reading the API output though.👍_

_If my skull ascii is too much you could always change the .zshrc to load neofetch instead, or do what I do, use both. I have the motd set to load when I use the 'r' alias and I have neofetch set to load when I clear the screen with the 'c' alias. Of course, you can always &lt;control&gt;+l if you want neither._

## Starship prompt configuration file

I've set up the starship.toml config file to have the prompt look like the powerline prompt. I've set it up using iTerm2 so the colors may be broken on an other terminal app. Also 'magenta' wasn't working for some reason. Not sure if it's a bug with starship or with iTerm2. I got around it by hard-coding the color with a hex color.

Dynamic icons! 🥹

![prompt icons examples](/assets/prompt-icons.png)

You'll want these two lines at the bottom of your .zshrc:

```zsh
export STARSHIP_CONFIG=~/path/to/starship.toml
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```

If you're using my 'new-mac-setup' script, it will automatically retrieve my dot files and so the lines will be there but since my actual dot files are in this repo the 'path/to/starship.toml' is a symlink and you'll want to change that anyway. For reference my symlink is in `~/.config/starship/starship.toml`.

### Where's my minimalist prompt? 🧐

This is obviously overboard for some people. You can simply delete the sections you don't want from the 'format' block at the top of 'starship.toml'. You don't have to worry about deleting formatting and styling blocks lower in the file.

_Example_ Delete these lines for a minimalist prompt with only the user name, directories, git branch & status, and last-command status:

## iTerm2 color presets file

The file, zsh-colors.itermcolors, is to load the colors I use into iTerm2. Feel free to use your own, but I figured I'd include this as well to avoid any legibility or contrast issues on your machine. The less tweaking the better right? Just import them from this 'color presets' menu in iTerm2 settings.
